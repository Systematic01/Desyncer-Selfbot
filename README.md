# Desyncer-Selfbot
Selfbot Source code of Desyncer. Don't skid and just learn from it.-

Does it work?
Yes and no, to avoid skids using my code I have made some errors and removed some code (such as the authentication system). Developers will be able to fix those, skids prob not. 

Can I use it?
Yes, license file is included. Feel free to use the source to LEARN from, if you distribute it I will open an official case with the authorities against you.

Is it skidded?
No, I once skidded at the beginning but even that was to hard for me. So in August 2021 I fully rewrite the code to what it currently is.

Why is your English so bad?
I don't know lol.

Why do you publish it?
I made it for fun, not for the money. But since a few months I was out of ideas and didn't had fun coding it anymore so I think its time to release it as open-source.


Love to everyone that bought it before!

ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU'RE A SKID THEN GO AWAY AS MOST ERRORS YOU FIND ARE MADE BY ME, SO IF YOU ARE A REAL DEVELOPER YOU COULD EASILY FIX THEM.
