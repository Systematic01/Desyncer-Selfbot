# Desyncer Selfbot

## Overview

Desyncer Selfbot was developed in 2019 by me (Systematic) and one of my friends (can't link his Github here). Desyncer is a Selfbot for the Discord Application which could be used to snipe nitro links, server invites, auto-join prizes etc. In addition, Desyncer has been developed for executing commands that are normally only suitable for Discord Bot Accounts, such as; sending embeds, spoofing links, automatically updating messages, automatically adjusting activity status, deleting messages after X number of minutes and much more...

## The end of Desyncer

Around June 2021 we decided it was time to stop the Desyncer project, it had around 200 users at that time and the project was mainly private available (access could be purchased for a few bucks). Because we did not want to let our users down, we made the source code public in this repo after taking our authentication server offline (however, certain functions, including some commands and the login/registration process, have been omitted)

## Installation

No documentation provided, but most of us that have some knowledge about Discord bots and Python in general will understand the installation of this bot (install what's needed, set your config and you're good to go)
